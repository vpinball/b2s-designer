# B2S (Backglass 2nd Screen) Designer

It allows you to edit and create directB2S backglasses for the [B2S.Server](https://github.com/vpinball/b2s-backglass) using a "WYSIWYG" editor.

Documentation is available in the package as html-help but can also be read [online here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vpinball/b2s-designer/master/b2sbackglassdesigner/b2sbackglassdesigner/htmlhelp/Introduction.htm).

**NOTE** If you are having problem opening the html-help B2SBackglassDesigner.chm file, try right click and select Unblock. *This is a security feature of Windows*

## Developers

To build either B2S.Server or B2S.Designer, open the *.sln files in Visual Studio (any version from 2019 should work) and select **build**->**Build Solution** from the menu.
Microsoft has prepared VM's that include Windows 11 and Visual Studio in one bundle. The licence for these is usually 3 months. This is an easy way to test if it works without having to install lots of different components.
