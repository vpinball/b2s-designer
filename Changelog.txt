2.1.0
- Increased Max ZOrder to 19 from 9 by jonesyUK
- Fixed bug (Issue #13) thanks funjup for the fix!
  Adding a new bulb frame would sometimes calculate it's location having negative coordinates, placing it off the workspace, especially if zoomed in or having a large frame duplicated.

  Now:

  - if a frame is selected (in focus), it will duplicate it with a small shift (20 pixels) so can easily be grabbed, and can be counted if duplicating multiples.
  - if a frame was recently selected but no longer in focus, the new frame will be placed with a certain offset (20%) from the top left corner of the user's viewing window. This way a new frame is always placed within the user's working area as they move around the canvas when zoomed in.
  - if no previous frame was selected to duplicate, the default Size is now 200x100px (was 300x100).
